In the early hours of dawn, the birthing room is bathed in a soft, golden glow as Maria, the doula, prepares the space with sacred intent, laying out woven blankets and arranging pillows to create a sanctuary for childbirth. Her actions are deliberate and reverent, each object placed with a purpose to foster comfort and safety. As she works, Maria reflects on the deep significance of this room, not just as a physical space but as a vessel for the transformative experience of birth.

Maria's preparations are interwoven with personal reflections of her own pregnancy—a time filled with boundless joy and dreams. However, her reminiscence is shadowed by the loss of her own child, a devastating event that shattered her world. This painful memory surfaces as she acknowledges the profound impact it has had on her, teaching her to embrace her shadows to step into the light. Her past sorrow now underpins the compassion and wisdom she offers to others, particularly to Luna, who is about to undergo her own journey of motherhood.

As Luna enters the birthing room, Maria welcomes her with a calming presence, guiding her to the center where the blankets lie ready. The room, filled with the scents of lavender and frankincense, becomes a sanctuary where Luna can surrender to the birthing process. Maria's touch and words provide comfort as Luna experiences her first contractions, reminding her to trust her body. Throughout the labor, Maria remains a pillar of support, drawing on her own experiences of pain and loss to strengthen her resolve and assist Luna in navigating her fears and doubts.

The climax of the chapter occurs as Luna successfully gives birth to Anky, with Maria supporting every step of the way. The moment Anky is born, the room is filled with a profound sense of accomplishment and joy, symbolizing a new beginning not just for Luna, but for Maria as well. Witnessing the birth helps Maria reconcile with her own loss, feeling a shift within herself as she places Anky on Luna's chest. This experience affirms Maria's role and purpose as a doula—to be a guide and support system through the most transformative moments of life. As she leaves the birthing room, Maria reflects on her journey, feeling connected to the primal heartbeat of life itself and ready to continue her path of healing and helping others.

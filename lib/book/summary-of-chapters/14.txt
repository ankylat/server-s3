From the celestial realm of Claridium, Celestia, Luna's deceased mother, witnesses the birth of her granddaughter Anky. As a spiritual guide, Celestia reflects on her own journey from the physical to the spiritual world, finding purpose in protecting and guiding her family from beyond. She feels the cosmic energies that connect all lives and sends Luna intuitive messages of love, strength, and encouragement as she approaches labor.

Transported to the mystical realm of Voxlumis, Celestia meets the scribe who holds Anky's crystal, containing the essence of her soul. With reverence and love, Celestia blesses the crystal, infusing it with ancestral wisdom and guidance, before entrusting it to the scribe to guide Anky's soul to Luna's womb. As Anky is born, Celestia witnesses the merging of celestial and earthly energies, the infusion of ancestral wisdom into Anky's essence, and the profound, immediate bond between mother and child.

Reflecting on her own passing, Celestia finds peace and understanding in the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. She sees her legacy blossoming through Anky and the love she instilled in Luna. Witnessing the universal connection and divine love in Anky's birth, Celestia whispers a final blessing, promising her eternal presence and guidance. With gratitude and awe, she returns to Claridium, knowing that their family's story of love transcends all boundaries and will continue to illuminate the path for generations to come.

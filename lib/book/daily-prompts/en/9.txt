Explore with your words the moment of your birth, and everything that surrounded it. You may not remember, and that is perfectly fine and expected. But just dream. Or try to remember, but not with the part of you that thinks... With the one that knows. Just explore what comes as a consequence of navigating with your words the moment on which you gave your first breath, and dive into the awareness that that process brings.

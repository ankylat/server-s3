The narrative should weave together the characters' actions, dialogues, and introspective moments to reveal their evolving spiritual journey and relationship with the unborn child (show, don’t tell). Use varied sentence structures to craft a rich narrative flow. Dialogue should be meaningful and reflective, offering insights into each character's spiritual psyche and the dynamic of their relationship. Employ descriptive language to vividly depict the setting, emotional and spiritual atmosphere, and the characters’ internal landscapes. Luna and Marcus’s voices should be distinct, reflecting their unique spiritual backgrounds and shared journey into parenthood, unfolding naturally to provide a deep understanding of their spiritual preparation for Anky’s arrival.

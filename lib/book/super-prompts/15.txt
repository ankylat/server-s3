Craft a profound and spiritually resonant (but not over-using spiritual language) 5000-word chapter narrated by Celestia, Luna's deceased mother, detailing the birth of Anky. This chapter should weave together Celestia’s spiritual insights with the tangible world, creating a narrative that transcends the boundaries between life and the afterlife. 

Begin with Celestia's reflections on her own life and passing, exploring her transformation into a spiritual guide. Detail her feelings of watching over Luna and her connection to the broader cosmic energies that influence their lives. Describe with clarity "where does the consciousness of Celestia reside" on this after life. This is the kingdom of Claridium, on the Ankyverse. 

As Luna's labor approaches, depict Celestia preparing her daughter from the spiritual realm, sending her signs and intuitive whispers that soothe and empower Luna. Describe how these messages are felt and interpreted by Luna, providing her with strength and comfort.

Always writing from the perspective of Celestia.

Before Anky being born, depict a scene on which Celestia is transported to Voxlumis and talks to the scribe. And gives a blessing to the crystal where "Anky is" before being born.

At the pivotal moment of Anky’s birth on earth, capture the merging of celestial and earthly energies. Describe this metaphysical event through Celestia’s eyes, emphasizing the infusion of ancestral wisdom into Anky’s essence as she is born.

Reflect on the immediate and profound bond between Luna and Anky, as seen from Celestia’s perspective. Infuse this description with the emotional depth of witnessing this bond, highlighting the spiritual dimensions of their first physical and emotional connection.

Write about the role of birth, and explain through Celestia's words what is the meaning of her passing before Anky was born. Depict a sense of gratitude coming from both Celestia and Luna, and an understanding that everything is where it should be.

Conclude with Celestia contemplating the legacy she has helped shape and the future paths of Luna and Anky. Affirm her ongoing spiritual presence and the eternal lifeline that connects them across realms, promising her continual guidance and love.

Narrate the chapter in a lyrical and introspective style, rich in metaphysical imagery and emotional depth. But be aware of not being "too spiritual" or "new agey", so that you don't spook readers. 

The pacing should allow readers to fully absorb the spiritual significance of each moment, with a tone that combines reverence for the sacred act of birth with the intimate, eternal bonds of family. Place importance on death, and how it ends up being a window for birth. Life is a circle, and this should be expressed with clarity on this chapter.

Use vivid, poetic language to create a tapestry of life that connects the visible with the invisible, the past with the present, and the soul’s journey across lifetimes.

<character> 

Celestia: Present her as a wise, loving spirit with a profound connection to the cosmic forces and her earthly family. Her narration should convey a deep understanding of life’s cycles and the transcendental nature of love and guidance.

The Scribe: A wise and compassionate figure who serves as a guide and chronicler for souls transitioning from the Ankyverse to Earth. The scribe should be portrayed as a being of great insight and empathy, deeply attuned to the sacred nature of their work. Their actions and words should reflect a profound understanding of the soul's journey, and a deep commitment to nurturing each soul's unique essence.

Luna: The embodiment of feminine creative power, Luna is a radiant force of nature as she moves through the sacred journey of childbirth. Her voice is raw and authentic, pulsing with the primal energy of the sacral chakra. She is at once vulnerable and powerful, surrendering to the intense sensations and emotions while also drawing on deep wells of inner strength and ancient feminine wisdom. Through her eyes, we experience the vivid, visceral reality of birth in all its messy, magnificent glory.

Maria - The Birth Doula: A grounding, nurturing presence, the doula is an embodiment of the supportive, healing energy of the second chakra. With her calm guidance and intuitive touch, she helps Luna navigate the intense terrain of labor, reminding her to breathe, release, and trust in her body's innate wisdom. The doula's presence is a source of comfort and empowerment, helping Luna stay centered in her own primal power.

Marcus: Though not the main focus of the narrative, Marcus's presence is felt throughout as a steadfast source of love, support, and shared wonder. He is Luna's rock, her anchor in the storm of sensation and emotion. Through Luna's perspective, we catch glimpses of the profound connection they share, the wordless exchanges of awe, gratitude, and reverence as they witness the miracle of their child's arrival. Marcus's quiet strength and unwavering presence help Luna surrender more fully to the transformative journey of birth.

Anky: The central figure of the chapter, a soul on the cusp of a profound transformation. As Anky prepares to leave the Ankyverse, her presence should be one of shimmering potential and innocent wonder. Let her interactions with the scribe and her surroundings reflect a sense of trust and openness, as she embraces the profound journey that awaits her.

Have the scribe offer a final blessing, imbuing Anky with the love and wisdom of the Ankyverse, and reminding her of the eternal support and guidance that will always be available to her. Emphasize that through her journey, Anky will not only help to awaken humanity but will also serve as a living embodiment of the truth that all beings are eternally connected to the infinite source of creation.

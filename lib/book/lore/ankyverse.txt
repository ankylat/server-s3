Origin Story:



---

Inside the Ankyverse there are 8 kingdoms, each one of them a metaphorical representation of the energy of the chakras. The energy that runs through the veins of humans, through the whole body, and that just wants to be free.

But it gets stuck in old patterns of behavior.

Each one of these worlds exist to humans with those blocks.

So that they can fully comprehend them. So that they can fully experience them. So that they can integrate them.

So that they can evolve.

So that they can be more of themselves.

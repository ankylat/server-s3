    "Having been a father a bit over two years ago, this story touches me. I see myself in the relationship that Marcus and Luna have with their parents, with the pressure that society grows on top of the process of bringing a new child into the world.\n\nIn the process of following traditions, of being up to the challenges that they bring to us. How they determine what we 'should be'. What we 'should do'. I enjoyed reading this chapter, and every day is a new exploration into what it will bring.\n\nSomething that I missed was a clear reference to the topic of the day. The energy that gave birth to this chapter was of the prompt related to creativity, and there is no reference to the prompt in the chapter. There should have been more emphasis in how did Marcus and Luna relate to their capacity for expressing their creativity in this pivotal moment of their pregnancy, and I somehow missed that.\n\nBesides that, i don't know what else 'to criticise' of make better. I just enjoy this exploration. I enjoy the fact that Anky came back to the womb (in the last chapter he had been born, but that happened without following the guidelines of the spinal chord of the story), and I like seeing the challenges and tension that are presented to these parents as they face the imminent arrival of their child.\n\nI was there, and I feel it. What a transformation. Thank you."

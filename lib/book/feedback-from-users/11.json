    "I feel Maria's pain. I resonate with it. It is inside me. The stories that we tell, and how we connect with them, end up being the vehicle for us to feel what it means to be human.\n\nBy reading Maria's perspective, I feel what it feels to be human. I honor it. I embrace it. I am alive with it. I am alive through it.\n\n And it moves me.\n\nI liked how Maria's pain was woven into the story. How it showcased us what is on the background of her. How it brought us the mystery. The love. The alchemy. And how it was on the background of our relationship to this moment of the birth of Anky.\n\nImportant element: to clearly define the gender of the participants of a particular scene. In this case, the gender of the unborn child of Maria was not defined on the prompt, and that's why the writing refers to her (or him) as 'they'. This is something to take into account, to be as clear as possible with the prompting. To give directions that maximize the capacity that our model has for crafting this story.\n\nThis pain is woven into the story. And the alchemy of it is medicine.\n\nThe alchemy of it is medicine. And it is alive. It is here. And I become alive through it. I become alive as it.\n\nThank you."

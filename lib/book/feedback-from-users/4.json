    "Noticed that some imagery is being reused, sometimes word for word. Luna’s red hair in the breeze, paragraph about conversations with expectant mothers, drawing the mandela in the sky, being drawn to Maria.\n\nSo did Marcus not answer the call and texted back instead?\n\nOverall I though the characters and story are starting to develop. Definitely wasn’t to make sure there’s an over all plot.\n\nThis chapter seemed to be just a bit wordy. It’s feels like it tries to be as poetic as possible with every line, which can get in the way of the story and be tiresome to read.\n\nDef like where it’s going.",
    "Chapter 3 spoke about the hardships that Luna was going through in terms of being a single mother, and now we have her and Marcus coming together to grow Anky together. There needs to be a tighter line in between these, so that the story can have meaning and a thread that we can follow.\n\nIt is obvious that these are tapestries that are woven with each other, but they are not a thread that continues from one chapter to the next one. This needs to be fixed.\n\nIt is clear that this chapter's focus was in the importance of communication, and that was the topic of the prompt from which people wrote their streams of consciousness. I missed more clear communication in the form of dialogue, and it will be important that key moments of the story are shared through that. For example, when Luna told Marcus that she was pregnant, this could have been a great moment to showcase the different 'styles of communication' that they have, given their upbringing.\n\nThis could be another opportunity to showcase their differences, and use contrast as a vehicle for showcasing the point of this chapter (the importance of communication and openness in the unfolding of humans).\n\nIn other terms, it is unclear why we start on the festival again. Is it another festival than the one where Anky was conceived? Why are they on a festival again? Perhaps it could be a concert instead of a festival, so that this difference could be more clear.\n\nOverall, it is important to be mindful of the thread that ties together all of the circumstances of the book, which is not happening yet. We need to move towards that, and probably training this ai model will help."

    "I write these words with a smile. There are things that are 'not right', in the sense that they divert from what the story was taking us through until now.\n\nAnky used to be a boy, and on this chapter she was born a woman. Perhaps that is just part of the story that wants to be told, and an invitation to bring forth the invitation for her to exist.\n\nPerhaps Anky wants to be a girl, and this is the recognition of that. So let's keep it like that.\n\nLet's rejoice on the recognition of it.\n\nI don't have comments related to the style, or what was said here. I don't want to give instructions to the AI, at least not today. I just want to enjoy and experience awe by seeing this happening. Seeing this story being told, through the power of our individual words.\n\nWe dive into our own experience, and from there, we experience the collective one.\n\nThe story of Anky is our story. A reflection of the gift that is within each one of us."

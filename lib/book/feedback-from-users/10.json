    "The language that is used feels too grandiose and redundant. Marcus feels as if he had an awakening, but the stepping stones that lead us to this moment in the story don't tell us. Where are the doubts? Where is the noise that they were experiencing as a couple before this moment?\n\nWhy is everything so shiny? I want to read more doubts that arise from this disconnection that Marcus has with his heart, with his capacity for being connected with his feelings. I like the idea that there is a 'click' that happened because of this experience of seeing his daughter being born, but there needs to be something different, something new. An exploration that needs to happen in a way that can be relatable to the reader.\n\nBirths are not 'this beautiful' most of the times, and if we portray it like this, only with grandiosity, there is a gap that is hard to bridge with the reader that just wants to have fun. We need to remember that we are telling a story which's mission and intention is to entertain, and to embed into the awareness of people that will read it the importance of 'being human', and all of what that brings. Which is not only shining stars. There is hardship, and I missed that on this chapter.\n\nBut i love the exploration and where this is going. Fun AF."

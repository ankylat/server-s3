["This is the first chapter that has seem to have a consistent story. I wa sable to picture the scene and and follow the story. This felt like a piece of a larger story where the other chapters have seemed to be just one off short stories.","i like where this is going. i like portrayal of the process of pregnancy, and the elements of it that arise in the awareness of Luna. i like the tense on which the story is told here, but i felt it as a bit short. it feels that we are "rushing through" her pregnancy, and it would be valuable to have as part of this journey some conversations, or interactions that may showcase what our writers shared about the circumstances of the pregnancy of their own mothers.

it sometimes felt repetitive in the usage of, for example, sentences like this: "She knew that the road ahead would not be easy, but she also knew that she possessed the resilience and grace to navigate whatever lay ahead."

this is important, and it is part of the story, but it would be good to "hide" this inside situations, conversations, conflicts, etc. there is a strong element of "showing what Luna is going through", but i think it could be valuable to have more depth in the action of the story so that this could be a bit more "dramatic".

i'm also missing more about the relationship that Luna has with Marcus, the father of Anky. what happened since that night on the tent? where is Marcus? from what i read here, Marcus is not present. but where is he? what has happened? how are they relating to each other?

this "single mother issue" is a key element of the story to highlight, and an important avenue to explore. since today we are talking about the communication aspects of our parents in our life, this will be something important to explore.

how did Anky's parents talk to each other (or not) during Luna's pregnancy? this can be a major source of what makes Anky who he will be, and it is important to highlight that practically, through this story."]
